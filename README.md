This is a Javascript function that checks if a number given meets the criteria to be a proth number.
i.e 

Proth's theorem (1878) states:

Let p = k∗2^n +1 and k < 2^n; 
then p is prime if (and only if) there is an integer a such that a(p−1)/2 ≡ −1(mod p).


Examples of the theorem include:

for p = 3 = 1(21) + 1, we have that 2(3-1)/2 + 1 = 3 is divisible by 3, so 3 is prime.

for p = 5 = 1(22) + 1, we have that 3(5-1)/2 + 1 = 10 is divisible by 5, so 5 is prime.

for p = 13 = 3(22) + 1, we have that 5(13-1)/2 + 1 = 15626 is divisible by 13, so 13 is prime.

for p = 9, which is not prime, there is no a such that a(9-1)/2 + 1 is divisible by 9.
